# point_cloud

## Background
It has been found that it is occasionally necessary to mask point clouds in advance of alignment and averaging. Often spatial filtering is not completely effective in removing spurious points, or there are portions of a surface measurement result that the analyst does not want to consider. In the latter case, this includes wire entry/exit artefacts, localized plasticity effects near restraint features and so on.

A tool has been developed to perform this type of masking, called point_cloud. It is intended to operate on two types of data:

1. Point clouds generated by laser profilometry after primary processing
2. Point clouds generated by Coordinate Measurement Machines (CMMs) as primary processing

The function allows a user to load and visualize a point cloud, select points to be deleted and then write an output file containing the point locations and whether they were masked. This function does not delete points, merely creates a new file containing this information.

There is one main GUI-enabled function, called `mask_def`. This can be accessed by running `from pyCM import point_cloud`.

## Initializing
Analysis starts with loading the perimeter and point cloud for each surface.

**Input and output descriptors for the `mask_def` function**

Input | Description
---  |---
Perimeter file |	*Optional*. Only text files are supported. If not specified directly, location is acquired via GUI.
Point cloud file |	Text, data and MAT-files are supported. Path dependencies are the same as the perimeter file. If not specified directly, location is acquired via GUI.
Output directory |	Specification of where the results *.mat file is written. If not specified, the location is acquired via GUI.

Output | Description
---  |---
Output file	| A *.mat file will be written to the specified output directory. At minimum, it will contain two data structures needed for subsequent processing, *ref* and *float* which contain the following:<ul><li>x,y,z: N×1 arrays of the masked coordinate values. *this will be eliminated with the next refactor*</li><li>rawPnts: N×3 matrix of the points read in via the point cloud file.</li><li>mask: 1×N array of int8 values consisting of 0 and 1 where 0 indicates a masked point. Conversion to a boolean array will provide an index of rawPnts that were masked.</li><li>fname: file name of where the point cloud data was imported from </li><li>x_out: N×3 matrix of the points that comprise the outline</li></ul> 

The function is called from a Python script or in interactive mode, starting by importing point_cloud module from the pyCM package and then calling the `mask_def` function via: 
~~~
mask_def()
~~~
This will load the perimeter file located in the current working directory, the point cloud file with prefix 'Points' located in the same - the perimeter prompt can be cancelled if alternate formats are employed. Note that in total 2 GUIs prompts will take place, one for each the perimeter and point cloud data sets.

##  Interaction functionality
The data will appear in a custom VTK interaction window after initializing, with data appearing in white (points) or lines on a dark background. The default view is looking down on the data in the z direction, after which the view can be rotated to show the data in perspective ([Fig. 1](#fig1)) by pressing the left mouse button. The middle mouse button provides a pan function while pressed, and the right mouse button zooms. There are three named views that are accessed via **1**, **2** and **3** looking down the z, x and y directions, respectively.

*<a name="fig1"></a> Figure 1: Main default interaction window with a dark background and white data and annotations. Perimeter is shown as a solid line, with axes to show scale.*

For publication purposes, the ability to flip the default color scheme (dark on bright) has been provided. This is obtained by pressing f ([Fig. 2](#fig2)) on the keyboard. Again, for publication purposes, a facility has been provided for printing the interaction window to file. Pressing **i** will print the interaction window to the current working directory as ’point_cloud.png’.

*<a name="fig2"></a> Figure 2: Flipped colour scheme with a white background and black data and annotations. Pressing f on the keyboard when the window is in focus flips to and from this scheme.*

As contour data has dimensions that are sometimes orders of magnitude larger in x and y, a facility for increasing the x, y and z-aspect of the data has been provided, depending on the radio button selected at the left-hand side of the GUI. Pressing **z** increases the aspect ratio by 2x with each keypress, pressing **x** decreases by half, and **c** returns to the default aspect ratio. These same keys have been also mapped to increase/decrease the size of the points themselves: pressing **Shift+z** increases point size, **Shift+x** decreases it and **Shift+c** returns to default.

Masking of points to be discluded in the subsequent analysis can be accomplished with two techniques: a wholesale reduction of points, or more selectively with a picking tool. The *Pick options* pane's first option is to reduce points by a percentage: entering a value in the spinbox beside the *Reduce* button will eliminate that same amount of points, percentage-wise. For example, a value of 10 will leave 90% of the points.

In order to select masked points, there is an interaction sequence which is triggered by pressing *Picker*. Pressing **r** will disable rotation such that using the left mouse button will enable the user to draw a rectangular window around points to be masked ([Fig. 4](#fig4)). This rectangle can be drawn and redrawn any number of times; panning and zooming are accessible by pressing **r** once more. The *Pick active* pane will activate when the picker is active. This can be repeated any number of times. If a mistake is made, then the last pick can be undone with the *Undo last pick* button to deselect all highlighted points the last time the picker was active. Note that a hardware selection tool has been employed: only points that are visible in the particular view/orientation will be selected. If a mistake is made, then the entire dataset can be reloaded with the *Reload source* button.

*<a name="fig4"></a> Figure 4: Points to be eliminated/dismissed from subsequent analysis can be selected, as can the overall point cloud using the **Pick options** pane.*

Once the required points have been added to the mask, then the function can then write a *.mat file for the displayed perimeter/point cloud, targeting the structure identified with the radio button in the *Write output* pane. If this *.mat file has not been generated, then a GUI will prompt for a location. If there is already a *Reference* or *Floating* data series in the *.mat file, the user will be asked if they wish to overwrite.

The process can then be repeated for the other perimeter/point cloud combination by pressing the *Load* button at the top left of the GUI.

If both the reference and floating datasets have been written, then pressing the *Load *.mat* button will permit the user to see the result from masking - what the next step will use as input.

A complete list of interaction keys is provided below.

## Known issues

Loading of extremely large datasets has shown to create serious lag. Point clouds are better off sampled and reduced before using these tools. Not all hardware is supported; OpenGL errors have been noted when using 4k displays.
